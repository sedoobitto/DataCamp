## SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF BAYES' KIDNAPPING.

##### This repository contains course work on the challenge to solve the mystery of Bayes' kidnapping and facilitation of his safe return to his DataCamp family.

##### Modules and Variables.
Learned about modules and variables while filling out Bayes' missing puppy report. Worked with the two common types of variables : strings (Which represent text like Bayes' fur color) and Floats (which represent numbers like Bayes' age).

##### Functions
Used the license plate lookup function to get the first list of suspects.

##### Working with tabular data
Narrowed the list of suspects by using Pandas to examine credit card records. Investigated the credit reports using functions such as head() and info() to select specific rows that correspond to suspicious purchases using logic.

##### Line plots
After narrowing the suspect pool down to two people, handrwitten samples were collected and analyzed using line plots.
* plt.plot() : to create the line plots
* plt.legend() and plt.title : to add annotations to the line plots

##### More plot types
used matplotlib to create several other plot types.
* Scatter plot : to investigate cell phone data and narrowed the suspect's location to three possible campsites.
* Bar charts : to track how Officer deshaun and his friends used their time to solve the mystery.
* A histogram : to investigate the distribution of gravel radii on the Suspect's shoeprint.
